Brief:
It is the year 2053 and a seemingly incurable pandemic has swept the globe. 
The leading laboratories are so close yet so far with a cure, but one has made it to clinical trials: Calthorpes Laboratory. 
However, in the days since the announcement of clinical trials, the facility has gone dark. 
You have been tasked to search the lab for various keycards to get around, whilst collecting and reading elements to learn about what really happened.
